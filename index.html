        <div class="subheading mb-5">Liberal Studies and Education MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a 3rd year student at the University of California-Riverside where I am double majoring in Liberal Studies and Education. After obtaining my BA, I hope to attend grad school to earn my teaching credential and masters degree in education so I can become an elementary school teacher. I have dreamt of being an elementary school teacher since before I started kindergarten and am extremely determined to make this childhood dream a reality.<br><br>
I have volunteered at St. Thomas Episcopal Preschool in Temecula, CA for the past 4 years. I help the children ages 2-5 learn academic skills like their letters and coloring inside the lines aswell as social skills such as sharing or followind directions. I also have previous experience in a school setting volunteering in a 2nd grade classroom at Paloma Elementary in Temecula, CA. There, I helped direct children in lessons and activities revolving around spelling, reading, math, and science. Outside of the classroom, I have further practice working with children as a member of Project Sunshine in Riverside, CA. For a year now, I have visited children of various ages in the pediatric unit, playing games, making crafts, or simply talking with them while they are in the hospital. <br><br>
        In addition to education, sports have always been a passion of mine. I have been fortunate enough to combine these two passions by becoming an assistant soccer coach for Temecula Valley Soccer Association. For the past 3 years, I have coached 10 teams of girls and boys between the ages of 10 and 18 at both the recreational and all-star levels. My duties include teaching the children both basic and advanced skills, creating and implementing drills, writing line-ups, and ensuring the physical and emotional well-being of the athletes. I also have been a referee for the soccer league since 2018. In addition to enforcing the laws of the game, serving as a center referee has the added responsibilities of making all final decisions and ensuring that all the players, coaches, and members of the referee crew properly understand the rules.
